                                install Terraform on Ubuntu 16.04
  To update the system and packages, you can use the built-in software updater, or manually update the system with:
     
            $ sudo apt-get update
 
 Again, we will install wget and unzip packages if theyâ€™re not already installed:
                       
            $ sudo apt-get install wget unzip

 Also next, we will run the same commands as we did with ubuntu 14.04:

            $ wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.11.13/terraform_0.11.13_linux_amd64.zip

            $ sudo unzip ./terraform_0.11.13_linux_amd64.zip -d /usr/local/bin/

 And finally, to test if our installation was successful:

            $ terraform -v
